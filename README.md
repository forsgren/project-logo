# Project Logo

If the file `project-logo.svg` is found in the `.vscode` folder, it will be displayed in the explorer view.

The purpose of this extension is to provide a simple way to display a logo in the explorer to quickly identify projects - and to provide eye candy.

I'd recommend using a logo that goes well with both light and dark themes, a way around any issues is to place the logo agains a colored background.
