# Project Logo

The purpose of this extension is to provide a simple way to display a logo in the explorer to identify projects quickly - and to provide eye candy. Having a logo in the Explorer view is also a great way to give a visual cue to the user that the project is active.

If the file `project-logo.svg` is found in the `.vscode` folder, it will be displayed in the explorer view.

I'd recommend using a logo that goes well with both light and dark themes, a way around any issues is to place the logo against a colored background.
